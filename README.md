# 🧠 DSA-C (Data Structures & Algorithms in C)

Welcome to my **DSA in C** repository!  
This project contains my code and notes while learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using the **C programming language**, inspired by **Shraddha Didi (Apna College)** 💙

---

## 📘 About the Project

This repo is made to track my DSA journey from basics to advanced —  
covering every important concept, logic, and implementation step-by-step in **C**.  
Each topic is properly organized and documented for easy understanding and revision.
